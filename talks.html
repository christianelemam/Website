        It is a classical fact that any isometric embedding of the round sphere in the Euclidean space is obtained by a rigid motion. On the other hand it has been known since longtime that there are isometric embeddings of the hyperbolic plane in Minkowski space which are not umbilical. This phenomenon is related to the lack of compactness of the hyperbolic plane.
        Indeed the classification of properly embedded spacelike hyperbolic surfaces in Minkowski space relies on a notion of an asymptotic boundary, which can be regarded as a closed subset of the Penrose boundary of Minkowski space. In a  work with Andrea Seppi and Peter Smillie we proved that there exists a bijective correspondence between asymptotic boundaries and properly embedded spacelike surfaces in Minkowski 3-space.
        However, typically those surfaces are not geodesically complete, so the space of embeddings of the hyperbolic plane in Minkowski space is still not understood.
        In a work in progress with Andrea Seppi and Peter Smillie we are investigating how the regularity of the boundary is related to the completeness of the surface.
        In the talk I will introduce the problem, explain the state of the art, and illustrate some recent results achieved with Andrea Seppi and Peter Smillie.</div>

        Given a closed hyperbolic surface S, we consider quasi-Fuchsian
manifolds homemorphic to SXR. We study their measured foliations at
infinity which are the horizontal measured foliations of the Schwarzians
derivatives obtained on the boundary at infinity by Uniformising their
respective complex structures. We then discuss how given a pair of measured foliations (F,G)
 that fill a closed hyperbolic surface 
 how tF and tG (where t>0 is small enough denotes the measure being
scaled by a factor of t) can be realized as the measured foliations at
infinity of a quasi-Fuchsian manifold which is sufficiently close to
being Fuchsian. Starting from the definitions, the plan of the talk will
be to give an overall picture of the setting of the theorem with the proof and see how it draws parallels to a similar result of Bonahon for
bending measured laminations of a quasi-Fuchsian manifold.</div>

        Let G/H be a homogeneous space where G and H are reductive Lie groups, both noncompact. For instance, G/H could be the pseudo-Riemannian hyperbolic space H^{p,q} = SO(p,q+1)/O(p,q) for p,q\geq 1. In order to understand compact manifolds locally modeled on G/H, we study properly discontinuous and cocompact actions of discrete groups on G/H. We prove the so-called Sharpness Conjecture: such actions always satisfy a strong form of properness called sharpness. As an application, we show that when the real corank of G/H is one (e.g. G/H = H^{p,q} with p>q), any discrete group Gamma admitting a properly discontinuous and cocompact action on G/H is Gromov hyperbolic, and the set of such actions is characterized by an Anosov representation condition, defining an open subset of Hom(Gamma,G).

        Positivity is meant as a generalisation of the cyclic order on the circle and the notion of monotonicity a map from a cyclically ordered set in the circle.
<br>
        Generalisation of the idea of positivity appeared to be crucial in understanding some connected components of  the space of representations of a surface group in certain  Lie groups G, although the common phenomenon was not figured out until recently.
    <br>    
        In this talk, based on a preprint with Olivier Guichard and Anna Wienhard,  I will start by examples generalizing this notion of cyclic order on the circle: convex curves and configurations in the plane, time like curve in Minkowski space. Then I will move to the general geometry of parabolic spaces and explain why the notion of positivity relates to special configurations of pairwise transverse triples and quadruples of points. This notion of positivity, which abides simple combinatorial properties, allows to define positive - or monotone - curves, then positive representations of surface groups. Positivity may not always exists and its occurences have been classified by Guichard—Wienhard.
        <br>
        I will then sketch the proof of our main result: positive representations are Anosov and  fill up connected components of the space of representations.</div>

<div class="abstract"><span class="abstract">Abstract: </span>
Abstract: We show that the existence of hyperbolic manifolds fibering over the circle is not a phenomenon confined to dimension 3 by exhibiting some examples in dimension 5. More generally, there are hyperbolic manifolds with perfect circle-valued Morse functions in all dimensions n<=5. As a consequence, there are hyperbolic groups with finite-type subgroups that are not hyperbolic.

The main tool is Bestvina - Brady theory enriched with a combinatorial game recently introduced by Jankiewicz, Norin and Wise. These are joint works with Battista, Italiano, and Migliorini.</div>

        Surprisingly there exist connected components of character varieties of
        fundamental groups of surfaces in semisimple Lie groups only consisting
        of injective representations with discrete image. Guichard and Wienhard
        introduced the notion of &#x398;-positive representations as a
        conjectural framework to explain this phenomena. I will discuss joint
        work with Jonas Beyrer in which we establish several geometric
        properties of &#x398;-positive representations in PO(p,q). As an
        application we deduce that they indeed form connected components of
        character varieties.

        Recently, Markovic proved that there exists a maximal
representation into (PSL(2,R))^3 such that the associated energy
functional on Teichmuller space admits multiple critical points. That
is, there is more than one minimal surface in the corresponding product
of closed Riemann surfaces. We plan to discuss some aspects of the
geometry of these minimal surfaces. We will explain that there is a
relation to a notion of convexity for singular flat metrics, which has
other interesting applications. This is work in progress, partially

        In 2003 Donaldson applied infinite-dimensional symplectic reduction to prove the existence of a mapping class group invariant hyperKähler structure on an open neighbourhood of the Fuchsian locus in the space of quasi-Fuchsian manifolds. In this talk, I will discuss a similar question for the Lorenzian counterpart of quasi-Fuchsian manifolds, namely maximal globally hyperbolic Anti-de Sitter manifold, showing that the natural object that appears in this context is a para-hyperKähler structure. This structure recovers many of the previously known constructions, due to Mess, Krasnov-Schlenker, Bonsante-Mondello-Schlenker, and others.

	<div class="abstract"><span class="abstract">Abstract: </span>
        In 2013, Rossi proved that if a maximal globally hyperbolic
        (abbrev. MGH) conformally flat spacetime has two distinct homotopic
        lightlike geodesics with the same ends then it is a finite quotient of
        the Einstein universe. In this case, the ends of such lightlike
        geodesics are said to be conjugate. In the continuity of this result, I
        am interested in describing MGH conformally flat spacetimes  with
        complete lightlike geodesics (i.e. which develop as  lightlike geodesics
        joining two conjugate points in the Einstein universe). In this talk, I
        will  describe an example that I call  a Misner domain of the Einstein
        universe. Under some hypothesis, I prove that the universal covering of
        a MGH conformally flat spacetime with complete lightlike geodesics
        contains a Misner strip. The goal would be to prove that any MGH Cauchy
        compact conformally flat spacetime can be obtained by grafting (or
        removing) a Misner strip from another one. This would be the Lorentzian
        analogous of the operation of grafting on hyperbolic surfaces introduced
        by Thurston.

        A long standing question asks which reductive homogeneous spaces G/H admit a properly discontinuous and cocompact action of a discrete subgroup of G. The « sharpness » of such actions (see Fanny Kassel’s presentation) provides new obstructions to their existence, showing for instance that SL(n+1,R)/SL(n,R) does not have compact quotients for any n>2. A more refined topological obstruction, obtained jointly with Fanny Kassel et Yosuke Morita, gives the non-existence of compact quotients of many pseudo-hyperbolic spaces H(p,q).
